# Giving Advice is Flawed
<Date> Jan 04, 2026 </Date>

Most people give poor advice,<sup>1</sup>  because they’re giving advice on what worked for them or what they wished they did looking back.<sup>2</sup> But what worked for them might not work for you. 

No one knows your exact situation except you. Trust your gut.

If you must take advice, take advice from people who know you well. People who have your incentives in mind. It doesn't have to align with theirs. And people who are one or two steps ahead of you. Someone who can remember the position you are in and decisions they made.

> Find people who want the same things as you and surround yourself with them.

When someone asks me for advice, this is what I like to say. Nothing more, nothing less. Not take this course, watch this lecture, or solve this problem. Only this.

<sup>1</sup> There are always exceptions.

<sup>2</sup> Often because they carry biases without realising it.
